# Translate libtool supplied C-compiler options for NASM.
# libtool treats NASM like the C compiler, and may supply -fâ€¦ options
# which are interpreted as the output file format by NASM, causing errors.
# Notably libtool will set -DPIC -fPIC and -fno-common;
# we want to use -DPIC by translating it to -DPIC=1, but remove everything else
#
# Theoretically the way the filtering is done here in a plain POSIX shell script,
# does mess up if there were spaces in any argument. However this will never happen
# since neither our filenames nor options do not contain spaces and source paths
# are not allowed to contain spaces by configure.
